  <h1>VCam Window for mmhmm</h1>

I want to use mmhmm input as a presenter in a web conferencing tool, but I can't use the presentation mode because it is a virtual camera input. To solve this problem, you need to output the webcam video as an application screen share rather than as a webcam input. The application can display virtual camera video, such as mmhmm, in a frameless window.
